#### About this course:

You'll learn fundamentals, 
It is for everyone who use computer and want to solve any problem.

Before we understand algorithms, we have to understand data types to store data. 

Because any problems we solve is a problem of humans or of real world but sometimes the virtual world, so we must know first how to store the data.
We will see Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queues,

Then we will study algorithms like searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, graph ...

Programs I'll write will be in java but can be re-written in any of the language.

Mainly we have to understand abstraction at very core.

Logic which we will develop will help to understand web, engineering systems,...

We will use data abstraction at most of the places, you will learn to define abstract data types. Implement ADT and provide API(application programming interface) and use as ckient in another class.


Mainly designed for 

## problem-solver
