In Java, an **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a collection of methods, classes, and interfaces that allow developers to interact with various functionalities. Java provides built-in libraries, and you can also create your own custom libraries.

## Java's Built-in Libraries (Standard APIs)

Java comes with a rich set of APIs that developers can use to build applications efficiently. Some commonly used libraries include:

### **a. Core Java Libraries**

- **`java.lang`** – Provides fundamental classes (e.g., `String`, `Math`, `System`).
- **`java.util`** – Contains utility classes (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Date`).
- **`java.io`** – For input/output operations (e.g., `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`).
- **`java.net`** – For networking (e.g., `URL`, `HttpURLConnection`).
- [Ref](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se10/html/jls-7.html)

### **b. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**

- **`java.sql`** – Used to connect Java applications with databases.
- Example:
```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "user", "password");
```
### **c. Java Collections Framework**

- Provides data structures like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and related classes.
### **d. Java Stream API**

- Introduced in Java 8 for processing collections efficiently using functional programming.

Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("A")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

## Third-Party Libraries in Java

Many Java projects use external libraries to extend functionality. Some popular ones include:

- **Spring Framework** (for building enterprise applications)
- **Hibernate** (for Object-Relational Mapping)
- **Apache Commons** (utilities for collections, I/O, etc.)
- **Google Guava** (additional collections and utilities)
- **Jackson / Gson** (for JSON parsing)


To use a third-party library, you can add it via **Maven** or **Gradle**.

Example (Maven Dependency for Gson):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
    <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
    <version>2.8.9</version>
</dependency>
```

## Creating Your Own Java Library (Custom API)

You can create your own reusable Java library and distribute it as a JAR file.

### **Step 1: Create a Java Class**

```java
package mylibrary;

public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### **Step 2: Compile the Class**

Navigate to the folder and compile:

```sh
javac -d . MathUtils.java
```

### **Step 3: Create a JAR File**

```sh
jar cvf mylibrary.jar mylibrary/
```

### **Step 4: Use Your Library in Another Project**

```java
import mylibrary.MathUtils;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathUtils.add(5, 10);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}
```


### **Step 5: Add JAR to Classpath and Run**

```sh
javac -cp mylibrary.jar Main.java
java -cp .:mylibrary.jar Main
```

The term **client** to refer to a program that calls a method in another library and the term **implementation** to describe the Java code that implements the methods in an API.

The purpose of an API is to separate the client from the implementation: the client should know nothing about the implementation other than information given in the API, and the implementation should not take properties of any particular client into account. APIs enable us to separately develop code for various purposes, then reuse it widely.

Separating client code from implementation code gives us the freedom to substitute new and improved implementations.
